# TypeScript learning tasks

## Description of the project

In this project, TypeScript was used to provide type annotations for functions and fix a 
flawed function. In Task 3, it was necessary to write a proper TypeScript function signature, 
including a separate description of the type for the first argument in the form of an 
interface. Open this in an editor with adequate TypeScript support.
